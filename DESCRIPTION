Title: Fit Univariate Distributions
Version: 0.6.0
Authors@R: person("Thomas", "Roh", email = "thomas@roh.engineering", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Wrapper for computing parameters for univariate distributions using MLE. It creates an object that stores d, p, q, r functions as well as parameters and statistics for diagnostics. Currently supports automated fitting from base and actuar packages. A manually fitting distribution fitting function is included to support directly specifying parameters for any distribution from ancillary packages.
